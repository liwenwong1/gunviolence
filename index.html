        The above map and timeline was created using data from the Stanford Mass Shootings in America dataset.
        It contains a comprehensive information on mass shooting from 8/2/1966 to 11/6/2016. 
        MSA defines mass shootings as <i>"3 or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities), not including the shooter; the shooting must not be identifiably gang, drug, or organized crime related."</i>
        Unfortunately, due to the signficant resource requirement for maintaining this dataset, the Stanford Mass Shootings in America database has been permanently suspended.

  <!---  These regulations appear to be effective as states with more gun regulations tend to have a lower gun violence death rate.
You can further explore the regulations using the visualizations below.-->


  <!---The table columns names have been abbreviated and are "Permit Required", "Purchase Permit Required", "Registration of Firearm",
 "Open Carry Allowed", and "Background Checks on Private Gun Sales Required" from left to right. The table is based off of handgun regulations as
 handguns and long guns are subject to different regulations.   Hovering over a circle in the scatterplot
 will display the name of the state, the number of regulations and the death rate.   --->

   <!--- <h4><u>Data</h4></u>
        <p> 
            Studies suggest that the US has the highest rate of mass shootings than any other countries and that the rate of mass shootings has tripled since 2011. 
            The below visualizations are based on the Stanford Mass Shooting in America, and other gun violence data sets, which began in 2012 in reaction to the Sandy Hook, CT shooting. 
            MSA defines mass shootings as <i> "3 or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities), not including the shooter; the shooting must not be identifiably gang, drug, or organized crime related."</i>  Through these visualizations, we hope to shed some light on how gun violence has changed and the 
            regulations in place to limit the number of lives taken.       </p>
